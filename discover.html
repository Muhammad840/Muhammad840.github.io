                <h3>Simplify profile management, enhance booking processes and standardize data capture with one global tool</h3>
                <p>
                    A well-constructed building starts with a solid foundation. The same is true for travel 
                    data. From travel booking services to reporting, data drives everything we do. When better
                    quality data goes in, better quality results come out.
                    <br>
                    A foundation of better travel data begins with using our proprietary travel profile 
                    management system to get your employees’ personal details right on every business 
                    booking. Our integrated, single-source global profile system powers all booking 
                    processes—online, offline and on mobile—driving a better, more consistent, booking 
                    experience with fewer errors.
                    <br>
                    Fully integrated with Menatours’ operational systems, traveler profile information 
                    automatically synchronizes with global distribution systems and online booking tools, 
                    helping to ensure each business booking incorporates current and accurate employee 
                    information and preferences. The system also saves time, facilitates service and 
                    increases employee satisfaction.

                <p>
                    Menatours helps you meet your legal and ethical obligations to care for your employees 
                    and reduce risk for your company. We’ll help you keep your employees and their data 
                    safe, stay compliant with applicable laws, and predict and manage safety and security

                </p>
                <h3>Raise the bar on employee care</h3>
                <p>
                    Your employees are your responsibility, so a top priority of your corporate travel 
                    program must be safeguarding their welfare. Menatours gives you access to critical 
                    tools, information and services that help you:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Stay informed about incidents that may affect travel, increase your organization’s 
                        exposure to risk, or jeopardize your employees’ health, safety or security.
                    </li>
                    <li>Locate and support your employees quickly in an emergency.</li>
                    <li>Take further action to enhance employee care and mitigate risk.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Take care of your employees and their information</h3>
                <p>
                    Looking after your employees’ well-being is a critical component of travel risk management (TRM)
                    , but it’s only part of the picture. TRM needs to include keeping their personal information 
                    safe too. At Menatours, data security helps shield unauthorized access while allowing data 
                    to flow smoothly through our systems. The architecture, design and support of our operations 
                    and systems reflect how information security permeates our company culture. So does our security 
                    awareness and compliance program, which focuses on protecting the confidentiality, integrity and 
                    availability of information. What’s more, we annually revise our risk, security policy and standards 
                    framework to address technology enhancements, emerging threats, data protection law updates, 
                    and other law or regulation changes.
                </p>
                <h3>Predict and plan for what may lie ahead</h3>
                <p>
                    Menatours helps you and your employees manage or avoid potentially dangerous or unproductive 
                    situations that may arise during travel. You get vital information that helps you predict, 
                    identify and monitor potential threats to the health, safety and security of your traveling 
                    employees. Your employees receive relevant, itinerary-based alerts via our traveler portal. 
                    Online advisories and your guidance empower employees to make proactive, informed decisions 
                    before they go.

                    Your employees are your responsibility, so traveler care must be a top priority of 
                    your corporate managed travel program. If you don’t plan for their safety, security 
                    and medical needs before a crisis arises, the financial implications could be exorbitant. 
                    More importantly, the impact on business travelers could be significant.
                    <br>
                    Menatours helps you meet your legal and ethical obligations to care for your business 
                    travelers and reduce associated costs. Travel risk management, medical assistance and 
                    security services can help you prevent a variety of incidents from escalating into 
                    costly situations.

                    anywhere in between—Menatours gives you access to critical tools, information 
                    and services that help you to:

                    advisories that help them plan, prepare, and manage potential risks and disruptions. Even when 
                    your employees are on the move, Menatours gives them access to traveler care right at their

                <p>
                    Some organizations are big enough to negotiate their own discounts with airlines, 
                    hoteliers and car rental companies; but those negotiations will never cover all of 
                    your business travel needs. That’s where Menatours comes in. As one of the leading 
                    business travel management companies, we have the buying power to negotiate deals 
                    with many leading suppliers, all around the world. Our deals can supplement yours, 
                    giving you travel savings in places you wouldn’t have on your own. If your company 
                    lacks the size, scope or resources to negotiate with suppliers, our deals can offer 
                    business travel savings—often including extra amenities—without the time-consuming 
                    contracting process for you.
                </p>
                <h3>The right price in the right place.</h3>
                <p>
                    All of those negotiations are wasted if your travelers can’t access your negotiated 
                    rates—or ours—at the point of sale, through every company-approved booking channel. 
                    Menatours’ single platform strategy ensures all of your employee booking options—phone, 
                    online and mobile—reflect your company’s preferred suppliers and rates. We even offer 
                    GDS rate audit services to ensure the rates in booking systems are actually ones you 
                    want your employees using. And, when your rate isn’t available, our broad array of 
                    negotiated supplier deals can still give your company business travel savings.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Even after booking, Menatours price optimization service can monitor airfares and hotel 
                    rates to take advantage of price drops. Our automated system does the hard work, and we’ll 
                    just contact your traveler if a lower price becomes available for the same type of booking.
                    Your employee makes the choice; your company enjoys the travel savings.

                <h2>Supplier management</h2>
                <p>
                    Traditionally, there has been a “set it and forget it” approach to sourcing – with 
                    annual or biannual reviews of supplier deals. We are bringing you a holistic approach 
                    to ensure you are getting the best possible return on your sourcing investment. 
                    Through dynamic sourcing strategies provided by our consultants, our deep knowledge 
                    of the supplier landscape means we are first to know about new entrants to the market, 
                    and industry trends.
                    <br>
                    With over 60 years of industry experience and a proven track record, our clients have 
                    seen an average return of $14 for every $1 they have spent with us.

                <h3>Corporate travel policy compliance</h3>
                <p>
                    A robust corporate travel policy helps you communicate clear guidelines for your company’s
                    expectations for traveling employees—helping you control travel costs and better care for
                    traveling employees. Savvy companies drive travel policy compliance by tailoring their
                    guidelines to their company’s culture, offering a business travel policy that matches
                    the level of flexibility and cost controls to the goals of their company.
                    <br>
                    Menatours can help make travel policy compliance easy for you and your employees. All Menatours 
                    booking channels—online, offline or mobile—can automatically filter search results by your company’s 
                    policy preferences, including preferred vendors, class of service, and cost. We make it our top 
                    priority to offer your employees the best possible choice for both their needs and your corporate travel policy.

                    It logs near real-time data of every travel booking, giving you an overview of what’s being spent 
                    where, when, and by whom. You’ll be able to see right away if a business traveler has booked outside 
                    your policy, helping you keep your employees—and your company’s budget—on track.
                </p>
                <h3>Improving travel policy compliance</h3>
                <p>
                    Travel policy compliance starts with clear guidelines and a well-communicated travel policy. 
                    Your business travel policy needs to be widely circulated and understood by your employees. 
                    There are several ways Menatours can help you promote travel policy compliance:
                    <br>
                    <strong>Integration </strong>– By automatically integrating your corporate travel policy
                    parameters into filtered search results, your employee will be presented choices that fall within the framework of your policy.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Reporting</strong>– You can keep a close eye on the bookings your employees make, 
                    generate reports to understand their behaviors, and ensure your travel policy evolves to reflect their needs and preferences.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Communication </strong>– Our automated messaging service helps you quickly get in touch 
                    with your travelers, to remind them of policy rules or make them aware of important or helpful 
                    information at any point in their trip. Employees are your responsibility while they’re traveling, 
                    and this enhanced service helps you better communicate and care for them.
